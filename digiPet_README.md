# üßê Project Introduction <a name = "project_intro"></a>
This assignment is `digiPet` which aims to demonstrate our competency with various controls based on what we have learned in Mobile Application Development. 

## Project Goal <a name = "project_goal"></a>
The goal of this project is to create a digital pet that contains the following features.

The pet should:

- maintain its state between app launches
  - start in some happy state
  - over time transition to some less happy state
  - regain happiness when "treated"
- respond to gestures for example
  - petting/swiping
  - patting/tapping
  - walking/dragging
- keep track of toys/inventory/points/whatever
- produce feedback for the user when events occur
  - vibration
  - sound
  - colours
  - animation

**In Scope** for this project, means that these are the items that I was able to implement.
- petState
- petState transitions to some less happy state or `worse` if there is no interaction done within a specified amount of time. clingy much
- regain normal state when interacting like patting or feeding
- sounds via expo-av

**Out of Scope** - items that I didn't have the chance to implement or include in this project because of `reasons`, but mainly due to insufficient time for a lot of stuff. Maybe for the final project. hmmm
- inventory
- haptics
- orientation
- expo-sqlite or database
