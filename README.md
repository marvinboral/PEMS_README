# üßê Project Introduction <a name = "project_intro"></a>
Our project name is Peer Evaluation Management System or PEMS which is an evaluation database management system for our System Analysis and Design course which is also known as the CIT 2775/76 Program. Currently, the client is gathering student information from Canvas and manually transposing it into an Excel spreadsheet, he must manually calculate the ratings of each student and the ratings they receive from their teammates, he must categorize them as well as provide his evaluation/rating to the students. This process takes excessive time and requires constant precision, which can be difficult to do when he has over 40 students‚Äô feedback and ratings to calculate and record.

The client is looking to create a database tied to a website that will allow students to log into their profiles and provide numerical and written feedback on each team member. The program needs to automatically calculate the scores entered by the students so that he can have grand totals for each student. The client also wants to be able to provide feedback to each student, view their feedback, view the ratings of other students, and generate a categorized report of the ratings by student or team.

**Purpose of Project:**
The project will facilitate the student evaluation process to enhance efficiency and accuracy, and provide insights through automated data collection, calculation, and presentation. The system that is being built in this project will be aligned to only two courses (CIT2275/6) and will not be integrated into Canvas. It will encompass two user types: **instructors** and **students**.

**Business Need:**
The project has been initiated to address the business need to streamline the current evaluation process. The existing manual data collection and calculation methods are time-consuming and inefficient, especially given the high number of student evaluations required. The need is to modernize and automate this process to improve efficiency and accuracy.

## Project Scope <a name = "project_scope"></a>
The project will facilitate the student evaluation process to enhance efficiency and accuracy, and provide insights through automated data collection, calculation, and presentation. The system being built in this project will be aligned to only two courses (CIT2275/6) and will not be integrated into Canvas. It will encompass two user types: instructors and students.

**In Scope**
- Data Collection
- Calculation
- Data Presentation
- Security
- Data Backup & Restoration

**Out of Scope**
- Course Alignment
- System Integration
- Excluded System features such as notifications and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

## Installing

Once you have installed the necessary software, you may get this online repository link from GitHub and Clone it to your local device. 

```
https://github.com/MartinRizada/PEMS.git
```
Navigate to the clientApp directory within your project
```
cd clientApp
```
