# üßê Project Introduction <a name = "project_intro"></a>
Our project name is Peer Evaluation Management System or PEMS which is an evaluation database management system for our System Analysis and Design course which is also known as the CIT 2775/76 Program. Currently, the client is gathering student information from Canvas and manually transposing it into an Excel spreadsheet, he must manually calculate the ratings of each student and the ratings they receive from their teammates, he must categorize them as well as provide his evaluation/rating to the students. This process takes excessive time and requires constant precision, which can be difficult to do when he has over 40 students‚Äô feedback and ratings to calculate and record.

The client is looking to create a database tied to a website that will allow students to log into their profiles and provide numerical and written feedback on each team member. The program needs to automatically calculate the scores entered by the students so that he can have grand totals for each student. The client also wants to be able to provide feedback to each student, view their feedback, view the ratings of other students, and generate a categorized report of the ratings by student or team.

**Purpose of Project:**
The project will facilitate the student evaluation process to enhance efficiency and accuracy, and provide insights through automated data collection, calculation, and presentation. The system that is being built in this project will be aligned to only two courses (CIT2275/6) and will not be integrated into Canvas. It will encompass two user types: **instructors** and **students**.

**Business Need:**
The project has been initiated to address the business need to streamline the current evaluation process. The existing manual data collection and calculation methods are time-consuming and inefficient, especially given the high number of student evaluations required. The need is to modernize and automate this process to improve efficiency and accuracy.

## Project Scope <a name = "project_scope"></a>
The project will facilitate the student evaluation process to enhance efficiency and accuracy, and provide insights through automated data collection, calculation, and presentation.

# üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites
What things do you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Visual Studio 2022
- NET Core 6 Framework
- C#
- Microsoft SQL 2019
   
## Installation Steps

- Visit [this link](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/devtools) to download the 2019 MS SQL Standard Edition.

### Installation of SQL Server
- Follow the installation instructions provided by Microsoft for installing the SQL Server.
- Check the Database Engine
- Set the Instance Name to: `PEMS_SERVER`

### Installing SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- After installing SQL Server, download and install SQL Server Management Studio from the official Microsoft website.

### Installation of Visual Studio Community
- Visit  [this link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) to download and install Visual Studio Community from the official Visual Studio website.

## Configuring SQL Server

### Restoring the Database Steps
- Follow these steps to restore a database:
  1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.
  2. Connect to your SQL Server instance.
  3. Right-click on `Databases` and select `Restore Files and Filegroups` 
  4. Choose the appropriate backup source (e.g., disk or URL).
  5. Select the most recent backup file
  6. Specify the destination database name: `PEMS`.
  7. Click "OK" to start the restoration process.

### Cloning Repo in Visual Studio Steps
- Follow these steps to clone a repository in Visual Studio:
  1. Open Visual Studio.
  2. Go to the "Team Explorer" tab.
  3. Click on the "Manage Connections" icon (usually looks like a plug).
  4. Click on "Clone" under the "Local Git Repositories" section.
  5. Enter the URL of the repository you want to clone.
  6. Choose a local path for the repository.
  7. Click "Clone" to start the cloning process.

## Running the Project in Visual Studio

Once you have cloned the repository and configured the SQL Server, follow these steps to run the project in Visual Studio:

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Open the project solution file (.sln) from the cloned repository usually named as PEMS.sln.
3. In View tab, click terminal it will show the developer powershell on the bottom of your screen.
4. Navigate to the file location of the project folder using: `cd`.
5. Navigate to the PEMS: `cd PEMS`
6. Navigate to the ClientApp directory: `cd ClientApp`
7. It should be like this: `C:\Users\yourname\source\repos\ProjectPEMS\PEMS\ClientApp`
8. Run npm install in the same directory location to install the dependencies: `npm install`
9. Change the database connection string based on SQL Server Name and Database name in the following location
    - appsettings.json
    - PEMSContext.cs 
      
11. Build the solution by selecting "Build" > "Build Solution" from the menu.
12. Press F5 or select "Debug" > "Start Debugging" to run the project.

## Additional Notes
